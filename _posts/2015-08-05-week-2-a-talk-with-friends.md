Even though Project Gather is inspired by my pain of organizing a night out with my friends back in high school, I haven't had the opportunity to pitch in this idea to them. So I did, to the boys in my high school days (we have a messaging group set up for us to reminisce about the past occasionally, so contact is easy).

The result was pretty positive as well. They were welcoming the idea of having a private space to organize events between close friends. Also as what I expected they would not want another messaging app for these features and would rather have them implemented on the existing messaging app,or switch projects and make a messaging app entirely.

I also raised the issue of monetization, of which they replied that they would rather use this system for free. This judgement might be biased with them, being Indonesian, rarely pays for services in a legal way. A friend mentioned about using normal banner ads, which is possible but is something that I want only to do as a last resort when all other business models fail.

He then mentioned about using sponsored content, making connections with businesses to promote their spot. This business model might be a good way to go — the way to get the businesses interested is to show them metrics of the amount of users and the percentage of which that uses the system to also browse for places to go. *More research needs to be done about how Foursquare, Twitter, and other companies that do sponsored content and place recommending operate on their business model*, as the method of how to charge the advertisers the most effective way is still unknown.

He also mentioned about having a particular user experience for event planning in a more simpler way — getting the people in the social circle to join the system on a certain group, then the system presents them a calendar interface on which the people can select dates that they are available on. From there on the system automatically picks a date then notifies the whole group about it to plan afterwards.

This is a good user experience, but goes against the approach I wanted on the user experience. I'd prefer having a group system where after inviting the necessary people, planning, and execution, the group gets deleted. That kind approach has its flaws and has been the reason of why a permanent group system works. The hassle of inviting the same people for the next event is why a permanent group system is more preferred than a once-per-event group system. *More user testing needs to be done on this* to understand which one the users would prefer.

In the end, after feedback has been noted, everyone wished well and looked forward for the project.

Outside of the chit-chat with my high-school friends, I took the time to set up this blog. Yes, the blog was set up on week 2 even though there is a post mentioning about the progress in week 1. Also technically week 1 is week 3 in the college term, but anyway.

I took the time to set this blog up using Jekyll and GitHub so I can write in Markdown in my text editor. Because of the demand from other groups wanting to use Jekyll, I took the time to make a [Yeoman generator](https://github.com/diagramatics/generator-project-journal) to scaffold a Jekyll blog with the same design style — simple and barebones. I use this generator for scaffolding a post template as well, so it's pretty handy even after initial setup.

SWOT analysis is still in progress since most of the time I spent in this week is for the blog and the generator, in which I'm pretty proud of. It's been an ultra-productive week, and hopefully I can catch up with more analysis as well as technical specification analysis soon.
