Hello! This is the first post for the journal.

So what is this exactly? This is a project journal for Project Gather, an upcoming project I'm going to pursue for the next 6 months. This is also a part of the Advanced Studio class I'm taking over at the college I'm attending at currently. I named it Project Gather for now as an internal name, and that I haven't found a great name for the whole project yet.

Project Gather, in short, is a system where close friends can organize a time and place to go out together. We have this problem on where the organizer often has trouble in tracking which of their friends can come or not, or agrees to come or not. This system solves the pain of that, as well as picking the place and time, designated drivers, where the friends are currently, and so much more.

For the first 3 weeks I have done a short project specification containing what I can think of in no particular order. The first 500 words explain about the system, why it differs from other event organizing system like Meetup, and onboarding users for the first time. Onboarding is a big challenge towards this project as nobody would not want to add yet another messaging chat app to the list, even though having a messaging chat system is necessary towards the functionality of the system as it relies heavily on communication.

For an effective onboarding process, I thought about integrating Project Gather with the existing messaging chat app, which is troublesome. LINE and WeChat has an API, as well as Facebook and Telegram, but WhatsApp doesn't have any API to tap into. The only way I thought of to make Project Gather work with them is with a bot, invited to the group chats of where the organizing takes place. This is bad for user experience as the organizer and the participants have to remember a number of commands to update the event details — something like the typical IRC commands (!host, /join, and the likes).

The initial pitch to the Advanced Studio class also garnered heavily positive feedback from the other teams and individuals, which is great! Somebody also mentioned about the barrier between social circles and that it is not a good experience to have the barrier made even more complicated. To put it simpler, if some mates want to go for a beer they wouldn't want an app to complicate the process of connecting them even further, or even keep track of where they at in a certain period of time before the event, or even if they would show up. That is a valid point, but there is nothing to be considered as this case serves as a very rare case of users not being able to see the benefit of the system and wouldn't be able to use Project Gather effectively — or to put it bluntly, not a member of the market.

Another points out that a feature to keep track of the budget of the event participants can be useful as well, as it can affect the place of the event, for example a diner or a four-star restaurant.

Inside the project specification I also outlined about monetization and how difficult it is to monetize this system as it is very personal and used between close social circles. Putting features inside a Premium Member package won't work and will affect in onboarding heavily — when a member of a social circle refuses to use Project Gather, there is a big possibility that the whole social circle will not use it either and just use the plain old communication as it is today. A viable way to monetize can be to provide features for enterprise use.

Closely tied to monetization, I also described briefly about the contingency plan of which if Project Gather failed to make an impact to the market, or failed to have any viable monetization plan, in which the system can be converted to only enterprise use such as meeting organizers, or for tour guide use as the system poses a similar user experience.

I plan to do a SWOT analysis and more talks with potential markets by the next week too, so expect a journal update when that comes!
